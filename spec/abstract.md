## Abstract

The `did:tdw` (Trust DID Web) method is an innovative enhancement to the
`did:web` protocol, focusing on secure and private digital identity management
through [[ref: Decentralized Identifiers]] (DIDs). It addresses the limitations
of `did:web` by introducing a ledger-independent verifiable history feature,
ensuring greater trust and security without compromising on simplicity.
Moreover, it incorporates a "/whois" path, drawing inspiration from the
traditional WHOIS protocol, to offer a decentralized trust registry. This
advancement aims to establish a more trusted and secure web environment by
providing robust verification processes and enabling transparency and
authenticity in the management of digital identities.
