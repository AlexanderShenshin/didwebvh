`did:web` + Verifiable History - The `did:webvh` DID Method
==================

**Specification Status:** UPDATE IN PROCESS

The `did:webvh` Specification Editors are currently making a set of
breaking changes to the DID Method. At this time, the next version of the specification has not
yet been given a version number. Once the set of changes have been approved, a version
will be assigned and made the latest version of the specification. Until
then, those looking for the current stable version of the specification should review
[v0.4](../).

The updates in process are:

- Adjusting the handling of pre-rotation keys and hashes.
- Changing how and where witness proofs are managed.
- Renaming the DID Method.

**Current Specification:**- [v0.4](../)
