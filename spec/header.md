Trust DID Web - `did:tdw`
==================

**Specification Status:** UPDATE IN PROCESS

The `did:tdw` Specification Editors are currently making a combination of
updates to the DID Method such that this version of the specification has not
yet been given a version. Once this set of changes have been approved, a version
will be assigned and it will be the latest version of the specification. Until
then, those looking for the current version of the specification should review
[v0.4](../).

The updates in process are:

- Adjusting the handling of pre-rotation keys and hashes.
- Changing how and where witness proofs are managed.
- Renaming the DID Method.

**Current Specification:**- [v0.4](../)

**Specification Version:** To Be Defined (see [Changelog](#didtdw-version-changelog))
